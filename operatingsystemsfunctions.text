The first operating system function I want to talk about is establishing an Internet connection. The nice thing about this function is that once it is done, you typically do not need to do it again unless you move to a new area. By connecting to the internet, you can access a variety of additional functions such as downloading and/or uploading content. You can also use the internet to stay in contact with family and friends that may not be reachable by phone or person. In the world today staying connected can be viewed as vitally important.
