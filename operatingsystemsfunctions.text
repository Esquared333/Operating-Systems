The first operating system function I want to talk about is establishing an Internet connection. The nice thing about this function is that once it is done, you typically do not need to do it again unless you move to a new area. By connecting to the internet, you can access a variety of additional functions such as downloading and/or uploading content. You can also use the internet to stay in contact with family and friends that may not be reachable by phone or person. In the world today staying connected can be viewed as vitally important.
An additional function of the operating system is administering security. Security in our connected world today is one our most vital functions of an operating system. Whether it comes to encrypting or decrypting files, storage of passwords or blocking of suspicious programs, the need for security is at an all-time high. Security is important not just for your computer, but for any device connected to your network. If one device on your network becomes compromised, it can make it easier to compromise other devices as well. This can not only result in loss of programs and data, but if you do financial transactions over the internet, those can be intercepted as well. The above mentioned and many additional reasons is why this operating system function is so incredibly important. 
The final operating system function we are going to talk about today is providing a user interface. User interfaces help make computers more accessible to those who may be less aware or educated about computer coding. Interfaces help us manage so many functions of the computer from security, to accessing the internet, creating files and content and so on. I personally am thankful for the simple user interface I have and its ability to help me manage and edit my personal photography.
